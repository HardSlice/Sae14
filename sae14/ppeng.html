    <p>I would like to become a network architect, I have two possibilities to get there to get there:</p>
<p>
    I can do a baccalaureate +5 in mulhouse or grenoble so another 2 years of study.
  I will get an engineering degree or I can also get a master’s degree if I decide to go
  in another school. I can also do a bac+6 in Paris in the Telecom school with here 3 years
  more studies.So I’ll finish my studies at the age of 23 or 24 depending on the school I’m in.
If I manage to get into a school I’ll have to move away from home and therefore to rent an apartment or student accommodation</p>

    <p>However, if I can’t get into one of those schools, I’ll go to work in a company in
    time as a network administrator because the B.U.T R&T is enough to become one. So I’ll finish my studies here
    at the age of 21 .
    After a few years of experience I will then be able to evolve and become a network architect and therefore
    achieve my goal.</p>


<p> What I love about this job is that in addition to managing and creating networks, there are a lot of
contact with customers, on the other hand on a negative point we can note that there is not much
 possibilities of evolution compared to other professions in the same sector.
On the positive side, there are many job vacancies, both in time and in time.
that Network Administrator  (if I don’t succeed in integrating one of the schools I want or if I
no longer want to study at the end of my BUT) and as a network architect,

  <br>On the negative side an architect network must also often work at the last minute because it is often called in an emergency. You have to be able to bear big responsibilities if you don’t want to burn
out. I will have to do sometimes overtimes.
</p>
<p>I don’t really have a preferred geographical area because I like to discover new places. For me there are just two small problems if I don’t work in Alsace/Franche-Comté, I’ll see less of my family and lose all my bearings.</p>
